This project is a mobile iOS application meant for connecting drunk folk.

When your in the middle of the club and meet an amazing person, it easy to get too drunk and forget you recieved their contact information.

TextClash aims to solve that problem. With TextClash, all you need to do is !BUMP! phones, and it opens a dialogue with the other person. SMS Away!
